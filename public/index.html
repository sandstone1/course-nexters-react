        should use to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface.
        The meta theme color tag will drastically increase the ‘wow’ factor of your website
        on a mobile device."

        From https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/ "Note that we normally
        encourage you to import assets in JavaScript files instead. Scripts and stylesheets
        get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests. However there is an
        escape hatch that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

        If you put a file into the public folder, it will not be processed by webpack. Instead
        it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the public
        folder, you need to use an environment variable called PUBLIC_URL.

        <!--
        Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
        It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
        Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

        Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
        work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
        Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
